Welcome to the Paystack Abantecart plugin repository on GitHub. 

Here you can browse the source code, look at open issues and keep track of development.

## Installation 

### Minimum Requirements

* Confirm that your server can conclude a TLSv1.2 connection to Paystack's servers. More information about this requirement can be gleaned here: [TLS v1.2 requirement](https://developers.paystack.co/blog/tls-v12-requirement).
* At least version 4.0.0 of the WPJobster theme

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as Abantecart handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Abantecart Paystack Gateway, log in to your Abantecart dashboard, navigate to the Integrations menu and click "Payments".

In the search field type “Paystack” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our payment plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Add to cart”, then complete the checkout process.
